Welcome to bitorch's documentation!
===================================


BITorch is a library currently under development to simplify building quantized and binary neural networks
with `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.
This is an early preview version of the library.
If you wish to use it and encounter any problems, please create an issue.
Our current roadmap contains:

- Extending the model zoo with pre-trained models of state-of-the-art approaches
- Adding examples for advanced training methods with multiple stages, knowledge distillation, etc.

All changes are tracked in the (CHANGELOG.md) `changelog <CHANGELOG.md>`_.
